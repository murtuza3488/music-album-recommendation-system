## Music Album Recommendation System
### Domain : `Recommendation Engine`
======

The dataset of this POC contains user ratings as well as song album details. 

The goal of this POC is to quantify different user clickstream data (like, dislike, add to playlist, ...) into a standardized metric parameter, and then apply statistical methods to filter out popular music albums. The nearest neighbor semi-sepervised recommendation engine then tries to learn popularity score based on a cosine-similarity metric.
